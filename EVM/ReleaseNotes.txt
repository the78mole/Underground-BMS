Added autoscroll capability to  CommandView.java
This is a crude implementation meant to provide useable GUI for the initial release on 9/13
The MinHeight setting needs to be updated to be accurate and take into account the layout and the width in order to compute the height at which scrollbar is a must.

Removed duplicate block of code in xml parser.
Updating PluginInfo objects.
Updating PluginInfo.java for learning cycle.
 
Removing all non Java files (.copyarea.db)
version 1.0.1
Added support for bq9000 Board Offset Calibration
Added API for bq9000 Board Offset Calibration
minor updates related to log viewer & log job
dashboard object to be initialized in constructor
commented out unused line which was causing NPE
updated to get dashboard info from ui.xml
SBS bug fix for legacy MAC command.
updated to send checksum to execute f/w
Adding global ui.xml file parser.
* Created separate package com.ti.evswsdk.global.ui.
* Modify plug-ins that parsed the file locally to read globally.


bqSBB v1.2.1 release

Known Issues/limitations
---------------------------

1.Installer: 
	1) Installing without uninstalling the old installation will add the plugins to the 
		existing installation as new ones will have a different timestamp compared to the existing ones.
		however the tool will pickup the latest one. it is recomended to uninstall the existing one & install a new one.

2.General :
	1) Connect device X  remove and connect device Y  Toolbar doesnt get updated.
	2) Some of the features will not work correctly if Java 1.7 & above is present on the system. (Java 1.6 is recommended)

3.Registers 
	1) clicking on sbs-item brings up a pop-up which can get hidden behind other windows based on location.
	2) "Date" is missing in log file header.
	3)Logging/Scanning starts even if no items are selected, however only the timestamp would be logged.
	4)Logging & Scanning at the same time might interfere & timestamps in the log might vary.	  
	5)Closing the registers view when logging doesnt release the file handle, thus doesnt allow to delete the file manually. closing the application will release the file handle	

4.AdvanceCOMI2C: 
	1) the transaction log show special characters when the no. of bytes to be read is more than 8.

5.Firmware: 
	1) sometimes the error message "command channel not found" is shown on the status line. restarting the app will solve this.
	
6.DashBoard : 
	1) There is no easy indication if the dashboard thread is running or not.

7.Datalog : 
	1) Add All register or DF Items might not display the table column headers correctly, will show some special characters, will be very slow.
	2) DF view needs to be opened before adding the DF items to the data log
	3) DF items with same parameterName (e.g. OCC1.threshold and OCC2.threshold) cannot be identified correctly if added on datalog
	4) During logging if the stop button is pressed, it may take little more time to complete logging and user may observe one or more extra entries in Table after STOP was pressed.
	5) During logging, if an item is removed, it may result into a crash

8.Datagraph : 
	1) It is Recommented not to add more than 20 itemson datagraph. More items can make view to freeze and make it unusable.
	2) The drop down list contains all items in the SBS & DF, hence many of them might not be appropriate for graphing. Ex: manufacturer info, etc..
	3) DF items with same parameterName (e.g. OCC1.threshold and OCC2.threshold) cannot be identified correctly if added on datagraph
